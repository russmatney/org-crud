# Org CRUD

A tool for reading and writing org content via clojure, as well as converting
org to markdown.

> Ninety percent of everything is crud.
> â€“ [Theodore Sturgeon](https://www.quotes.net/quote/53367)

## Status

Very alpha. I've recently namespaced the keys and flattened the props a bit.
Still waiting for things to settle.

I've used it internally for a few months, but the public api still needs to be
proven.

It works for my current use-cases, and there are unit tests! Feel free to take
it for a spin.

## Motivation

This library was pulled out of another tool, a productivity app built on top of
org-mode. That tool needed to be able to treat org files like a database of
items.

It was pulled out of that tool to allow a few other libraries to use it
independently (russmatney/ralphie), and also to add support for converting org
files to markdown. See [markdown](#markdown).

Org-crud aims to provide simple interactions with org files to clojure code.

## Background

There is not much to the parser besides a thin layer on top of
[organum](https://github.com/gmorpheme/organum). Organum does not nest the org
items - it returns a flattened list, regardless of the items' hierarchical
relationship. Org-crud provides both a flattened and nested option for parsing
org items.

This library is also [babashka](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka)
compatible, so you can drop it into a bb script without issue. This was
necessary for tools like [ralphie](https://github.com/russmatney/ralphie) to run
the exporter. You can see how ralphie consumes it [in the ralphie.notes
namespace](https://github.com/russmatney/ralphie/blob/f6432e433e7e447aa1c0784e62ade2935c557cfc/src/ralphie/notes.clj#L21)

## Features

- Babashka compatible!
- List nested or flattened org items
- Update existing org items
  - Updates by :ID:
  - Add/remove tags, properties
  - Change an item's name
- Delete org items
- Convert org files to markdown files

## Org Item Model

This library parses org "items" from a given `.org` file.

An example item looks something like:

```clojure
{:org/name "My org headline" ;; the name without the bullets/todo block
 :org/headline "** [ ] My org headline" ;; a raw headline
 :org/source-file "" ;; the file this item was parsed from
 :org/id #uuid "" ;; a unique id for the headline (parsed from the item's property bucket)
 :org/tags #{"some" "tags"}
 :org/level 2 ;; 1-6 or :level/root
 :org/body-string "raw body string\nwith lines\nof content"
 :org/body '() ;; a list of parsed lines, straight from organum TODO document this structure
 :org/status :status/not-started ;; parsed based on the
 ;; also supports :status/in-progress, :status/done, :status/cancelled

 :org.prop/some-prop "some prop value" ;; props are lower-and-kebab-cased
 :org.prop/some-other-prop "some other prop value"
 :org.prop/created-at "2020-07-21T09:25:50-04:00[America/New_York]" ;; to be parsed by consumer

 :org/items '() ;; nested org-items (if parsed with the 'nested' helpers)

 ;; misc helper attrs
 :org/word-count 3 ;; a basic count of words in the name and body
 :org/urls '() ;; parsed urls from the body - helpful for some use-cases
}
```

Items were originally implemented to support individual org headlines, but have
been adapted to work with single org files as well (to fit org-roam tooling
use-cases).

## Usage

TODO do some work on this section!

You can see the test files for example usage.

I'm attempting to hold a public api at `org-crud.api`, but that is a WIP.

### Parsing

```clojure
(ns your.ns
 (:require [org-crud.api :as org-crud]))

;; a nested item represents an entire file, with items as children
(let [item (org-crud/path->nested-item "/path/to/file.org")]
  (println item))

;; parses every '.org' file in a directory into a list of nested items
(let [items (org-crud/dir->nested-items "/path/to/org/dir")]
  (println (first items)

;; 'flattened' items have no children - just a list of every headline
;; (starting with the root itself)
(let [items (org-crud/path->flattened-items "/path/to/file.org")]
  (println (first items)))
```

### Updating

Updates are performed with a passed item and an update map that resembles the
org-item itself. It will use the passed item's id and source-file to find the
item to be updated, merge the updates in memory, then rewrite it.

```clojure
(ns your.ns
 (:require [org-crud.api :as org-crud]))

(-> (org-crud/path->flattened-items "/path/to/file.org")
    second ;; grabbing some item
    (org-crud/update!
      {:org/name "new item name" ;; changing the item name
       :org/tags "newtag" ;; adding a new tag
       :org.prop/some-prop "some-prop-value"
      }))
```

TODO document props-as-lists features
TODO document refile!, add-item!, delete-item!

### Markdown

Org-crud provides a namespace for converting org files to markdown, and a
babashka-based cli tool for running this conversion on the command line.

In order for this to work, you'll need to have Babashka (and clojure)
installed and available on the command line as `bb` and `clojure`.

From a local clone of this repo, you can run the conversion as follows:

```
# from this repo's root
bb -cp $(clojure -Spath) -m org-crud.cli org-to-markdown ~/Dropbox/notes tmp-out
```

Note that this support targets a use-case for publishing an
[org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/) directory as markdown, but
otherwise is probably not a complete org->markdown conversion solution. If you
have more use-cases that you'd like to see supported, please open an issue
describing the use-case, and I'd be happy to take a shot at it.

Note that Emacs/Org supports export that is fairly similar as well - I enjoyed
putting this together and not needing to leave the joy of clojure-land.

## Notes

### Item IDs (UUIDs)

Item IDs are more or less required for updating. Things will fallback to
matching on name if there are no ids, but this approach has a few issues,
because names are not necessarily unique throughout files.

I've updated my personal org templates/snippets in places to include IDs when
creating new items, and org-mode provides helpers that can be used to add them
without too much trouble. (Ex: `org-id-get-create`).

TODO share links to templates/snippets that create uuids

If this is a problem, let me know, there are other workarounds. Using IDs allows
for cases with repeated headlines in the same file - otherwise you might get
into tracking line numbers or parents, which did not seem worth it, especially
as my usage benefitted from the IDs elsewhere.
